## About the Project
Python was used to create this robotic Raspberry Pi project. Line-following sensors will allow the robot to follow lines placed on the floor.

## Part List
*I would reccomend getting good quality parts, my wires ended up breaking and my motor controller board arrived broken. Upon order of the parts online from AliExpress, delivery was expected in 30-50 days.*
* Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+, or 4
* Motor controller board (Model I used - L298 Dual H-Bridge)
* Two 3V-6V DC motors
* Two wheels that fit the two motors
* Ball caster
* Two line following sensors (Model I used - TCRT5000)
* Jumper leads (I would take cable length into consideration, female-to-female and male-to-female)
* Battery holder (if you want it to move freely of a power cable)
* A small chasis for the buggy (I used cardboard)
